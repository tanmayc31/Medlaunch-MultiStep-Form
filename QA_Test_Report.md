**Result**: ✅ PASS - All UI interactions work as expected

## 🐛 Bugs Identified and Resolved

### Bug #1: Progress Bar Mobile Overflow
**Issue**: Progress bar elements overflowing on mobile devices  
**Root Cause**: Fixed pixel widths (155px) not responsive on smaller screens  
**Resolution**: Added responsive CSS with percentage-based widths and flexible layouts  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Bug #2: Step 6 Data Not Rendering
**Issue**: Step 6 review page showing static data instead of real user input  
**Root Cause**: Components using hardcoded values instead of formData from context  
**Resolution**: Updated all Step 6 sections to pull data from formData state, added fallback values for empty fields  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Bug #3: Checkbox Auto-fill Not Working
**Issue**: "Same as Legal Entity Name" checkbox not populating DBA field  
**Root Cause**: Conflict between React Hook Form setValue and manual state management  
**Resolution**: Properly integrated setValue and getValues from React Hook Form with context updates  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Bug #4: Step Navigation Breaking with Validation
**Issue**: Form validation preventing proper step navigation  
**Root Cause**: Missing form wrapper and incorrect submit handling in Navigation component  
**Resolution**: Wrapped each step in form tags and used handleSubmit for validation before navigation  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
